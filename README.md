# Cats-Dogs-Predictor
A AI model which can predict whether the given picture is a cat or a dog. This model is based on CNN(Convulational neural networks).
It gives a validation accuracy of 74 percent and training accuracy of 100 percent which means it is probabily overfitting.
I'll try to increase its accuracy by using a extensive dataset and making tweaks in the neurons or maybe dropping out some neurons to avoid overfitting.


To-do:
resolve overfitting
Increase accuracy
implement it on a website
